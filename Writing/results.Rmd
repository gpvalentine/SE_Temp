There was considerable thermal variability between sites. Average weekly air temperature across sites was 10.99 $^\circ$C (SD: 7.74 $^\circ$C) and ranged from -15.03 $^\circ$C to 28.07 $^\circ$C. Average weekly water temperature across sites was 11.41 $^\circ$C (SD: 5.75 $^\circ$C) and ranged from 0 $^\circ$C to 27.83 $^\circ$C. Some sites had thermally resistant water temperatures, but others were sensitive (Fig. \@ref(fig:logistic-fits-plot)). Air and water temperatures generally were coolest in late January and early February, and peaked in mid-July. Minimum stream temperatures generally followed a latitudinal gradient, with the coolest minimums located in northern areas (Fig. \@ref(fig:min-max-interpolated-map-plot)), however maximum temperatures did not. Some of the coolest maximum stream temperatures were recorded at sites at southerly latitudes, but located at higher elevations.

## Logistic Model
Posterior predictive checks suggested little evidence of lack of fit between model estimates and data. Mean Bayesian p-values for mean and standard deviation were `r round(Weekly_Mean_Logistic_PPC_summ.table["Mean", 1], 2)` and `r round(Weekly_Mean_Logistic_PPC_summ.table["Mean", 2], 2)`. The nonlinear model had a mean R$^2$ of `r round(model_fits.table[2, "R2"], 2)` and an RMSE of `r round(model_fits.table[2, "RMSE"], 2)`. 

Thermal sensitivity differed greatly among the 203 sites, with evidence of thermal stability and thus thermal refugia. Logistic regression slopes ($\bm{\beta}$) varied from `r round(min(weekly_nonlinear_slopes.table$mean), 2)` (95% HPDI: `r round(weekly_nonlinear_slopes.table[which.min(weekly_nonlinear_slopes.table$mean), 4], 2)` to `r round(weekly_nonlinear_slopes.table[which.min(weekly_nonlinear_slopes.table$mean), 5], 2)`) to `r round(max(weekly_nonlinear_slopes.table$mean), 2)` (95% HPDI: `r round(weekly_nonlinear_slopes.table[which.max(weekly_nonlinear_slopes.table$mean), 4], 2)` to `r round(weekly_nonlinear_slopes.table[which.max(weekly_nonlinear_slopes.table$mean), 5], 2)`), with an average slope of `r round(mean(weekly_nonlinear_slopes.table$mean), 2)` (Fig. \@ref(fig:logistic-fits-plot)). Smaller $\beta$ values indicated less sensitivity in stream temperature to changes in air temperatures. These values were highly correlated with the minimum, maximum, and range of stream temperatures experienced among sites, indicating the robustness of this metric to evaluate spatial thermal heterogeneity (Appendix \@ref(fig:nonlinear-betas-corr-plot)). A latitudinal gradient in slopes was apparent, with less steep slopes (i.e. less sensitivity to changes in air temperature) generally present at southerly sites (Fig. \@ref(fig:slopes-map)). Geographically confined pockets of thermal refugia were also present at northern latitudes. Thermal sensitivity was spatially autocorrelated (Appendix \@ref(fig:logistic-weekly-betas-semivariogram-plot)), where nearer sites had more similar thermal sensitivity than farther sites (Fig. \@ref(fig:slopes-map)).

## Landscape Effects on Thermal Sensitivity
Spatial variability in thermal sensitivity was explained by landscape and hydrologic variables. In the PCA, the first five principal components explained `r round(pca_summary.table["Cumulative R2", "PC5"], 2) * 100`% of the variance in these variables (Table \@ref(tab:PCs-table)) and 16% of spatial variance in thermal sensitivity (i.e., $\bm{\phi}$ in Eq. \@ref(eq:MohseniModel)). Spatial thermal sensitivity was not significantly explained by PC1 (metrics of monthly and annual stream flows), but significantly explained by PC2 (spring to summer water velocity), PC3 (coordinates, baseflow index, precipitation, and air temperature), PC4 (winter water velocity), and PC5 (landcover and geology) (Fig. \@ref(fig:nonlinear-theta-posteriors-plot)). Specifically, stream temperature was more buffered from (less sensitive to) air temperature fluctuations at stream segments characterized by low spring to summer water velocity (PC2: 95% HPDI = `r round(nonlinear_thetas.table[2,4], 3)` to `r round(nonlinear_thetas.table[2,5], 4)`), southern latitudes with higher baseflows (PC3: 95% HPDI = `r round(nonlinear_thetas.table[3,4], 3)` to `r round(nonlinear_thetas.table[3,5], 4)`), high winter velocity (PC4: 95% HPDI = `r round(nonlinear_thetas.table[4,4], 3)` to `r round(nonlinear_thetas.table[4,5], 3)`), and high soil permeability, and predominantly colluvial sediment and deciduous forest (PC5: 95% HPDI = `r round(nonlinear_thetas.table[5,4], 4)` to `r round(nonlinear_thetas.table[5,5], 3)`).

To complement the PCA, correlation analysis of individual variables showed that stream temperature was more buffered from air temperature fluctuations when baseflow index was high (Pearson r = -0.45), segments were located farther south (r = 0.44) and in smaller watersheds (r = 0.40), and segments were characterized with lower stream flows in March (r = 0.40). Taken together, latitude and baseflow index (i.e., a metric of groundwater) were consistently identified as determinants of spatial thermal sensitivity in the two analyses.

## Predictions of Thermal Sensitivity
Predicted thermal sensitivity varied greatly among unsampled stream segments, with values of $\bm{\beta}$ ranging from `r round(min(trout_site_nonlinear_betas.table$pstr_mean_nonlinear_beta), 2)` (95% CI: `r round(trout_site_nonlinear_betas.table[which.min(trout_site_nonlinear_betas.table$pstr_mean_nonlinear_beta), 3], 2)` to `r round(trout_site_nonlinear_betas.table[which.min(trout_site_nonlinear_betas.table$pstr_mean_nonlinear_beta), 4], 2)`) to `r round(max(trout_site_nonlinear_betas.table$pstr_mean_nonlinear_beta), 2)` (95% CI: `r round(trout_site_nonlinear_betas.table[which.max(trout_site_nonlinear_betas.table$pstr_mean_nonlinear_beta), 3], 2)` to `r round(trout_site_nonlinear_betas.table[which.max(trout_site_nonlinear_betas.table$pstr_mean_nonlinear_beta), 4], 2)`; Fig. \@ref(fig:beta-predictions-plot)). Our predictions identified several areas most likely to serve as thermal refugia. Among others, the Pendleton County, West Virginia, Nantahala National Forest in North Carolina, and the Great Smoky Mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee were predicted to have particularly stable stream temperatures. Defining resistant thermal habitat as the lowest 25th percentile of predicted thermal sensitivity values, we found that 63% (1,367 of 2,175) of thermally resistant stream segments lay within protected areas. This compared to 54% (4,697 of 8,695) of all segments evaluated. The proportion of protected thermally resistant segments was significantly greater than the proportion of overall habitat (Pearson's Chi-squared p<0.001).

(ref:beta-predictions-plot) Predicted stream thermal sensitivity ($\bm{\beta}$) at 8,695 stream segments of brook trout habitat in the southern and central Appalachian Mountains region, USA. Thermal sensitivity was predicted using posterior estimates from Eqs. \@ref(eq:PCALinear) and \@ref(eq:MohseniModel), as well as spatially interpolated minimum and maximum stream temperatures. Lower values of $\beta$ indicate sites with less sensitive stream temperatures in relation to air temperature variation (i.e., thermal refugia).
