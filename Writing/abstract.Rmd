# Abstract
Warming water temperature as a result of climate change poses a major threat to coldwater organisms. However, the rate of warming is not spatially uniform due to surface-ground-water interactions and stream and watershed characteristics. Coldwater habitats that are most resistant to warming serve as climate refugia and identifying their locations is critical to regional aquatic conservation planning. Here, we quantified the thermal sensitivity of 203 streams providing habitat for brook trout (*Salvelinus fontinalis*) in the southern and central Appalachian region, USA (~1,000 km), and characterized their spatial variability with landscape variables available in the National Hydrography Dataset. We used the maximum slope of the Bayesian logistic function relating paired weekly mean air temperature and
stream temperature as an index of stream thermal sensitivity. Streams differed greatly in thermal sensitivity and those with more resistant water temperature regimes (i.e., climate refugia) were characterized with ..... Together, landscape variables derived from a principal component analysis explained 98% of variation in thermal sensitivity. Using our model and spatial interpolation, we predicted thermal sensitivity at 8,600 stream segments potentially suitable for brook trout in the study region. Climate refugia were more common southward presumably due to higher elevations, but they were also structured at finer spatial scales. Our analysis informs prioritizing habitat conservation and restoration of this native salmonid and other aquatic organisms that depend on coldwater habitats in a warming world.
