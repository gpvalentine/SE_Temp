# Abstract
Thermal stability is a critical influence on aquatic ecosystems. As climate change brings heat waves and droughts to coldwater ecosystems across the globe, habitat offering cool and stable water temperatures will be critical thermal refuge for aquatic organisms. Air temperatures, groundwater, and shading can all impact stream thermal stability, but little is known about the influence of local landscape. We use the maximum slope of the logistic function relating paired weekly mean air temperature and stream temperature as an index of stream thermal stability. We use public, national data to predict this thermal stability at 203 sites in the southeastern USA using a Bayesian hierarchical framework. Stream thermal stability was best explained by landscape and hydrologic variables including groundwater, winter water velocity, land cover, and soil moisture. Together, these factors explained 98% of variation in thermal stability and allowed the determination of habitats with highly stable and cool water temperatures. We further expand on our findings to predict thermal stability at unsampled sites throughout the study area. By identifying thermal refugia, our analysis will help managers conserve priority habitats and the populations that inhabit them.
