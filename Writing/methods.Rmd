## Dataset and Study Area

We collected paired air and water temperature data from 203 sites in the southern and central Appalachian region of the USA (Fig. \@ref(fig:sites-map), Table \@ref(tab:sites-table)). Sites in the southern Appalachians were generally situated at higher elevation than sites in the central Appalachians (mean 734 m vs. 563 m).  Sites were located in randomly selected watersheds identified as capable of supporting populations of brook trout [@ebtjv2006; @li2016]. Located at the downstream outlet of the watersheds, at each site a logger underwater was paired with a logger affixed to the bank or a tree. Stream and air temperatures were measured every 30 minutes using remote loggers (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA 02532). Loggers were deployed from 2011 to 2015. For data analysis, we summarized temperatures to weekly averages.

A common drawback of studies of thermal sensitivity is that air temperatures are derived from model outputs or the closest meteorological station [@beaufort2020; @hare2021; @kelleher2012]. This means that trends in air temperatures used for analysis may not reflect the true trends influencing stream temperature at the local scale [@kanno2014]. Solar radiation and the influence of local topography have been shown to substantial influence variation in the microclimate across the landscape, particularly in mountainous areas [@aalto2017; @tscholl2022]. Furthermore, weather stations are commonly situated in open, flat areas where they miss the thermal effects of topography and tree cover [@defrenne2016; @graae2012]. We overcame this problem by using air temperatures measured in-situ at the same locations where water temperatures are measured. By using these paired air and water temperature loggers, our study design therefore allows the consideration of highly local atmospheric influence on stream temperature.

Each site was linked using a GIS to the National Hydrography Dataset [NHDplus v2.1, @USGS2016] stream segment on which it was located. Using the NHDplus COMID code for each segment, we then accessed landscape metrics from the NHDplus and the Environmental Protection Agency StreamCat database [@hill2016]. Together, these sources contained 174 variables describing hydrology, land cover, geology, soils, and topography for each segment. While certain variables such as groundwater and stream size have well-defined influences on stream temperature [@beaufort2020; @chang2013; @mayer2012], we chose to include all variables in order to improve predictive ability.

## Principal Components Analysis

We performed a Bayesian principal components analysis (PCA) of the segment-level NHDplus and StreamCat predictors at 8,695 sites of known brook trout habitat identified in the USGS' EcoSHEDS (www.usgs.gov/apps/ecosheds) and by the Eastern Brook Trout Joint Venture [@ebtjv2006]. All 203 sites with paired stream-air temperature measurements were included in the 8,695 sites. We excluded sites with stream orders greater than five. Variables were centered and scaled. We used Bayesian principal components analysis (BPCA) due to its ability to take N/A values in inputs [@bishop1998; @nounou2002]. Analysis was completed using the “pcaMethods” package in R [@stacklies2007; @rcoreteam2022]. We then extracted the top ten loadings by absolute value for the first five principle components (cumulative R$^2$: 0.60). Lastly, we extracted PCA scores for each of the 203 stream segments where temperature was measured.

## Hierarchical Model

We used a Bayesian hierarchical logistic model to infer stream thermal sensitivity and the effects thereupon of local hydrology and landscapes. The regression slope at the inflection point of the of the function represents a first-order estimate of the relationship between air and water temperatures [@kelleher2012; @mohseni1998; @morrill2005]. We removed observations where water or air temperatures were missing. Adapting @mohseni1998, we fit weekly mean water temperature $T_W$ ($^\circ$C) at site $i = 1,...,203$ and week $t = 1,...,T$ as a function of weekly mean air temperature $T_A$ ($^\circ$C) with

\begin{equation}
  \text{T}_{Wi,t} \sim \text{normal}(\epsilon_i + \frac{\zeta_i - \epsilon_i}{1 + e^{\phi_i(\kappa_i - \text{T}_{Ai,t})}}, \sigma^2),
  (\#eq:MohseniModel)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\zeta_i$ is the maximum weekly mean stream temperature ($^\circ$C) at site $i$, $\epsilon_i$ is the minimum weekly mean stream temperature ($^\circ$C) at site $i$, $\kappa_i$ is the estimated air temperature at the inflection point of the function ($^\circ$C), $\phi_i$ is a measure of the slope of the function at $\kappa_i$ ($^\circ$C^$^{-1}$), and $\phi_i$ is derived from the linear function:

\begin{equation}
  \phi_i \sim \text{normal}(\theta_0 + \theta_1\text{PCA}_{1,i} + \theta_2\text{PCA}_{2,i} + \theta_3\text{PCA}_{3,i} + \theta_4\text{PCA}_{4,i} + \theta_5\text{PCA}_{5,i}, \sigma^2_\phi).
  (\#eq:PCAlogistic)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\bm{\theta}$ represents the contribution of each principal component to thermal sensitivity. The slope of the function at the inflection point (thermal sensitivity; $\beta_i$) at site $i$ is related to $\phi_i$ using the equation

\begin{equation}
  \beta_i = \frac{\phi_i*(\zeta_i - \epsilon_i)}{4}.
  (\#eq:CalcSlope)
\end{equation}

\noindent We visually evaluated spatial structure in thermal sensitivity by plotting semivariograms of $\bm{\beta}$ values using the 'geoR' package in R [@ribeirojr2022]. We also estimated thermal sensitivity using linear regression, and inferences of thermal sensitivity were nearly identical to those of the nonlinear approach (Appendix \@ref(linear-temperature-model)). Logistic regression slopes were also correlated with slopes from the linear regression (`r round(cor(weekly_linear_slopes.table$mean, weekly_nonlinear_slopes.table$mean, method = "pearson"), 2)`, Pearson's). We derived $C_\phi$ to quantify the proportion of variance in thermal sensitivity among the 203 sites explained by landscape variables.  Following @grosbois2009, $C_\phi$ compares the estimated variance in thermal sensitivity of the model including landscape covariates ($\hat{\sigma}^2_\phi(\text{res})$) to the estimated variance in thermal sensitivity of a null mode without any landscape variables $\hat{\sigma}^2_\phi(\text{tot})$:

\begin{equation}
  C_\phi = 1 - \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2_\phi(\text{res})}{\hat{\sigma}^2_\phi(\text{tot})}.
  (\#eq:C-phi)
\end{equation}

\noindent Assuming that the principal components explain some variation in slopes, $\hat{\sigma}^2_\phi(\text{res})$ will be smaller than $\hat{\sigma}^2_\phi(\text{tot})$, making values of $C_\phi$ range between 0 and 1, with larger $C_\phi$ values indicative of more variance explained by the principal components of landscape variables. We combined two methods to infer the effects of individual landscape variables on stream thermal sensitivity. We evaluated landscape effects on thermal sensitivity from the PCA by calculating the product of each variable loading in the PC and the posterior distribution of $\theta$ for that PC. We also calculated Pearson correlation between site-specific thermal sensitivity ($\bm{\beta}$ from \@ref(eq:CalcSlope)) and landscape variables at each site. We considered both quantities in evaluating the effects of individual landscape characteristics on stream thermal sensitivity.

To evaluate the performance of the model, we conducted posterior predictive checks for the test statistics of mean and coefficient of variation. These checks test for lack of fit using Bayesian $p$-values, defined as the probability that simulated data are more extreme than the observed data [@gelman2004]. Using this method, models with good of fit produce Bayesian $p$-values close to 0.5 (range 0-1). We also evaluated the model using the root mean square error (RMSE) of estimation and R$^2$. Lower RMSE values indicate better model fit, and higher R$^2$ values indicate greater variance explained. We implemented the model utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling using JAGS with the 'jagsUI' package in R [@kellner2021]. We provide code in online supplements and report noninformative priors in Appendix \@ref(prior-distributions). After a burn-in period of 1,000 samples, three chains were run until 5,000 iterations were reached. We considered convergence as an $\hat{r}$ value of 1.1 or less. We report posterior means as point estimates and 95% highest posterior density intervals (HPDIs) as estimates of uncertainty. We considered posterior distributions to be statistically significant when 95% HDPIs did not overlap with zero. We specified diffused priors for all model parameters, and used posterior mean predicted temperatures for subsequent analyses.

## Thermal Sensitivity Predictions and Gap Analysis

We predicted thermal sensitivity at unsampled brook trout habitat throughout the study region. In Section \@ref(principal-components-analysis), we calculated principal components for 8,695 stream segments of known brook trout habitat. Using these principal components and posterior distributions for $\bm{\theta}$ from Eq. \@ref(eq:PCAlogistic) and Eq. \@ref(eq:CalcSlope), we calculated $\beta_i$ for each segment. We interpolated minimum and maximum water temperatures at stream segments by kriging using the *spPredict* function in the spBayes package [@finley2015]. The minimum and maximum water temperatures were modeled using a linear combination of latitude, longitude, and elevation (m); and the spatial structures were modeled using an exponential covariance function based on pair-wise Euclidean distances.

Finally, we performed a gap analysis [@jennings2000] to evaluate the proportion of preferred thermal habitat that lies in conserved areas and compare this to the proportion of total brook trout habitat that occupies conserved areas. Gap analyses allow the identification of valuable habitat that is unconserved. We accessed a shapefile of protected areas in the study area from the US Geological Survey's Protected Areas Database [@PADUS2022]. We included protected areas with USGS Gap Analysis Project Status Codes 1-3. This included at the least protection from conversion of natural land cover and at the most National Park or Wilderness Area designation. In a GIS [@QGIS_software], we clipped all USGS NHDplus stream segments [@USGS2016] that were at least partially located in these protected areas. We then defined resistant thermal habitat as the lowest 25th percentile of predicted thermal sensitivity values. We calculated the percentage of resistant thermal habitat sites that were located on these stream segments within protected areas. Finally, we compared this percentage to that of all brook trout habitat sites that were located on stream segments within protected areas. This comparison allowe us to evaluated whether thermal refugia are better or worse protected than average.
