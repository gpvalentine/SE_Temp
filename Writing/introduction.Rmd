# Importance of temperature in aquatic systems
Water temperature is a critical component of freshwater ecosystems, determining species assemblages, organismal growth, and overall ecosystem health [@caissie2006]. It affects both primary and secondary productivity [@poff2002]. Most aquatic organisms have ranges of thermal tolerance [@coutant1977; @ebersole2001]. As global climate change brings increased air temperatures, water temperatures will similarly rise [@portner2022; @vanvliet2013]. High water temperatures will be exacerbated by the summer droughts expected in many temperate ecosystems. In conjunction with land use changes, invasive species, and altered hydrologic regimes, climate change will have significant adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems [@poff2002; @wagener2010].

# Brook trout in SE US
In the southeastern USA, brook trout (*Salvelinus fontinalis*) are a valuable native salmonid facing range-wide declines [@hudy2008; @flebbe2006]. They are highly sensitive to changes in water temperature, and cannot withstand temperatures higher than 22-24$^\circ$C [@eaton1995; @wehrly2007]. The southeastern USA is expected to experience acute effects of climate change [@ingram2013]. As climate change brings warmer and more variable water temperatures to the southeast USA, brook trout populations will increasingly reach or approach the limits of their thermal tolerances [@ingram2013].

# Influence on temperatures: air and landscape
Stream temperature, and the variability thereof, is known to be influenced by a multitude of atmospheric, hydraulic, and landscape characteristics and processes [@caissie2006; @poole2001; @webb2008]. Solar radiation and atmospheric air temperatures transfer heat into streams, while surfacewater, groundwater, and anthropogenic wastewater also interact with stream temperatures [@kelleher2012; @lalot2015]. These influences may be modified by local hydrology, riparian shading, and even local landcover [@mayer2012; @dugdale2018; @garner2015; @chang2013]. Local air temperature is commonly used to generalize atmospheric thermal influences on water temperature [@stefan1993; @caissie1998; @mohseni1998a].

# Thermal sensitivity
Thermal sensitivity, the relationship between water temperature and local air temperature, is an established measure of the thermal variance of a stream [@kelleher2012; @beaufort2020]. The concept encapsulates the resulting change in water temperature that results from a given change in air temperature. This relationship can represented by linear or nonlinear (i.e. logistic) regression, the fit of which depends on the streams in question, as well as the range of temperatures measured [@mohseni1999; @mohseni1998; @erickson2000]. In locations where air temperatures frequently dip below freezing, linear models can underpredict water temperatures. Also important for quantifying thermal sensitivity is the time scale at which air and water temperatures are summarized: depending on local hydrology, water temperatures can lag behind air temperatures by anywhere from hours to weeks [@stefan1993]. Most studies concur that increasing the temporal scale of summary results in higher correlation between air and water temperatures, with the best fits corresponding to weekly or even monthly time scales [@caissie2006; @webb1997a; @kelleher2012]. Thermal sensitivity is an important indicator of how water temperatures will respond to a warming climate.

# Transition
While work relating stream temperatures to air temperatures has been ongoing since at least the 1980s [@crisp1982; @mackey1991; @stefan1993; @webb2008; @mohseni1998a; @mohseni1999a; @erickson2000; @morrill2005; @zhu2018], less common are works relating thermal sensitivity to the mediating effects of local landscape and hydrology [@tague2007; @chang2013; @toffolon2015]. Previous research has identified groundwater inflows, riparian shading, and stream size as potential mediators of thermal sensitivity [@beaufort2020; @kelleher2012], however these influences vary greatly by study area. Studies that investigate drivers of thermal sensitivity at regional scales and offer scaleable and transferable methods are rare [@mayer2012; @beaufort2020]. We use a novel method to characterize landscape and hydrologic influence on stream thermal sensitivity across the native range of a threatened coldwater species in the southeastern USA. The brook trout (*Salvelinus fontinalis*) is an iconic game fish, the southern native range of which extends via the Appalachian Mountains through the southeast USA. Brook trout have a distinct preference for cold water [@mccormick1972; @wehrly2007], and thermal refugia allow them to persist when ambient stream temperatures exceed those at which they can grow, respirate, or survive [22-24$^\circ$C; @hitt2017; @petty2012; @trego2019]. This habitat preference means that brook trout thrive where they find cool, buffered water temperatures. The ability to identify and predict thermally suitable brook trout habitat is of the utmost importance for managers. We opt for a segment-scale approach to identify and predict thermally buffered stream segments using an extensive dataset of paired air and water temperature measurements.

Our study aims were threefold. First, we compared the fit of linear versus logistic regression and daily versus weekly temperature summaries in representing the relationship between stream temperature and local air temperature. Because of its ability to represent the nonlinear behaviors of water at high and low air temperatures, we hypothesized that logistic regression would better represent the relationship. We also hypothesized that weekly temperatures would offer better fit than daily temperatures. Second, we used widely available landscape and hydrologic metrics to identify drivers of stream thermal sensitivity. We predicted that __ would be the strongest predictors of thermal sensitivity. Lastly, we identified both vulnerable and resilient brook trout habitat, as well as predicted thermal sensitivity at unsampled habitats. In addressing these aims, we employed a multiyear dataset of over 150 paired stream and air temperature measurements spanning the range of brook trout in the southeastern USA.
