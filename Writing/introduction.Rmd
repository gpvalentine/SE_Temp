Water temperature is a critical component of freshwater ecosystems, determining species composition, organismal growth, and ecosystem functions and productivity [@caissie2006; @poff2002]. Atmospheric heat exchange is the key regulator of water temperatures, and air temperature is a common proxy for this exchange [@caissie2006; @mohseni1999]. As global climate change brings increased air temperatures, water temperatures will similarly rise [@portner2022; @vanvliet2013]. However, these changes will not be homogeneous: habitats that offer refuge from climate effects will be critical to coldwater conservation planning [@ebersole2020]. Thus, an understanding of spatial patterns and drivers of thermal sensitivity is of the utmost concern for scientists and managers. Furthermore, the ability to predict locations of climate refugia will allow focused conservation action.

In the southeastern USA, brook trout (*Salvelinus fontinalis*) are a valued native salmonid facing range-wide declines [@hudy2008; @flebbe2006]. They are highly sensitive to changes in water temperature, and cannot withstand prolonged periods of temperatures higher than 22-24$^\circ$C [@eaton1995; @wehrly2007]. Habitat with cool and stable water temperatures allows them to persist through heat waves and droughts [@hitt2017; @petty2012; @trego2019]. Thus, the ability to identify and predict thermally suitable brook trout habitat is of the utmost importance for managers. Brook trout habitat in the southeastern USA is expected to experience acute effects of climate change [@ingram2013]. As climate change brings warmer and more variable water temperatures to this region, brook trout and other sensitive aquatic taxa will increasingly reach or approach the limits of their thermal tolerances [@ingram2013].

Stream temperature is known to be influenced by a multitude of atmospheric, hydraulic, and landscape characteristics and processes [@caissie2006; @lisi2015; @poole2001; @webb2008]. Solar radiation and atmospheric air temperatures transfer heat into streams, while surfacewater, groundwater, and anthropogenic wastewater also interact with stream temperatures [@kelleher2012; @lalot2015]. These influences may be modified by local hydrology, riparian shading, and even local landcover [@mayer2012; @dugdale2018; @garner2015; @chang2013]. Local air temperature is commonly used to generalize atmospheric thermal influences on water temperature [@stefan1993; @caissie1998; @mohseni1998].

Thermal sensitivity, the relationship between water temperature and local air temperature, is an established measure of the thermal variance of a stream [@kelleher2012; @beaufort2020]. It is also an important indicator of how water temperatures will respond to a warming climate. Evidence suggests that stream thermal sensitivity is heterogeneous in space [@lisi2013; @lisi2015; @winfree2017]. This relationship is best represented by nonlinear (i.e. logistic) regression because it best describes the behavior of water temperatures at high (>25$^\circ$C) and low (<0$^\circ$C) air temperatures [@mohseni1999; @mohseni1998]. In locations where air temperatures frequently dip below freezing, linear models can under predict water temperatures. Also important for quantifying thermal sensitivity is the time scale at which air and water temperatures are summarized: depending on local hydrology, water temperatures can lag behind air temperatures by anywhere from hours to weeks [@stefan1993]. Most studies concur that increasing the temporal scale of summary results in higher correlation between air and water temperatures [@caissie2001; @webb1997], with the best fits typically corresponding to weekly time scales [@kelleher2012].

While work relating stream temperatures to air temperatures has been ongoing since at least the 1980s [@crisp1982; @mackey1991; @stefan1993; @webb2008; @mohseni1998; @mohseni1999a; @erickson2000; @morrill2005; @zhu2018], less common are works relating thermal sensitivity to the mediating effects of local landscape and hydrology [@tague2007; @chang2013; @toffolon2015]. Previous research typically tests the influence of a small number of factors and has identified groundwater inflows, riparian shading, stream size, and local geology as potential mediators of thermal sensitivity [@beaufort2020; @kelleher2012; @tague2007]. The influences of these factors can also vary by study study region. Studies that investigate drivers of thermal sensitivity at regional scales and offer scaleable and transferable methods are rare [@mayer2012; @beaufort2020]. Furthermore, researchers are often limited by stream temperature measurements that only exist in lower reaches of stream networks where monitoring gauges are located. This often requires pairing stream temperature observations with modeled air temperature measurements or those taken from afar. No study has yet been performed that employs spatially co-located and paired temperature measurements in headwater stream networks. 

Here, we characterize landscape and hydrologic influence on stream thermal sensitivity across the native range of brook trout in the southeastern USA. We opt for a segment-scale approach to identify and predict thermally buffered stream segments using an extensive dataset of paired air and water temperature measurements. We had two aims. First, we used widely available landscape and hydrologic metrics to identify drivers of stream thermal sensitivity. We predicted that measures of groundwater would be the strongest predictors of thermal sensitivity. Second, we made novel predictions of thermal sensitivity at unsampled brook trout habitat across the southeastern USA, using these predictions to identify both vulnerable and resilient brook trout habitat. In addressing these aims, we employed a multiyear dataset of paired stream and air temperature measurements at over 200 sites spanning the range of brook trout in the southeastern USA.
