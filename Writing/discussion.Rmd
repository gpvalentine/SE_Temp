Our work represents one of the most thorough analyses to date of thermal habitat for brook trout. We used observed air and water temperatures at 168 sites throughout the south and central eastern USA to quantify stream thermal sensitivity at multiple temporal scales using multiple models. We relate this thermal sensitivity to hydraulic and landscape characteristics, inferring local drivers that allow prediction at nearly 9,000 unsampled sites spanning 1,000 km. We found that a) weekly temperatures offered better fit than daily temperatures and the nonlinear models outperformed linear models in the southeast US region, b) thermal sensitivity is best explained by local hydrology such as catchment/watershed velocity ___, and c) __% of preferred thermal habitat in the southeast is currently conserved. Our results build on a solid base of investigation into stream thermal sensitivity, incorporating the influence of landscape variables and expanding analysis into new regions of interest. We emphasize the importance of hydrological variables in determining thermal sensitivity. By using widely available data, we can make predictions of thermal habitat for a vulnerable species and work toward landscape-level conservation planning.

## Landscape Influence

Thermal sensitivity in the maximum slope of the nonlinear weekly regression was most highly influenced by the principal component incorporating local groundwater influence, precipitation, minimum air temperatures, and winter stream velocity. Also significantly influential was the principal component incorporating local sediment and landcover. 
- @mayer2012 results show that streamflow is an important explanatory variable in predicting water temperature
- We expected that groundwater influence, as represented by baseflow index, would be an important predictor of thermal sensitivity (see @mayer2012 sec. 4.2 for more details)

## Model Comparison

We found that nonlinear regression offered improved fit over linear regression, a result that is shared by some [@kelleher2012; @mayer2012], but not all research that has compared the two [@beaufort2020; @laanaya2017]. These relative fits appear to vary by region, as differences in fits are mainly attributable to the range of air temperatures experienced in the study area.In locations where freezing air temperatures are rare (or removed for analysis), linear regressions often fit best. Where air temperatures below freezing are more common, nonlinear fits may be favored. Despite the fact that our study area was at relatively low latitudes, due to its elevation, it commonly experienced freezing temperatures. Future work should seek to establish how linear and nonlinear regressions of thermal sensitivity compare in regions that lack freezing air temperatures.

Our results continue to establish consensus for improved model fit using temperature measurements aggregated at increasing temporal scales. We found that temperature values summarized at weekly intervals outperformed those summarized at daily intervals. This finding is in agreement with those of other researchers that have compared model fits at multiple temporal scales [@stefan1993; @kelleher2012; @morrill2005]. The supposed reason for this is that by aggregating across a broader temporal interval, the time lag between air and water temperatures can be negated [@stefan1993]. The temperature metrics employed vary by study. @beaufort2020, @kelleher2012, use average temperatures, while @chang2013 use maximum temperatures. We elected to model stream thermal sensitivity using maximum air and water temperatures at daily and weekly intervals. It should be noted that because variance is generally dampened as values are averaged at increasing intervals, modeling average temperature at increasing intervals would by necessity result in improved fit with each increase. By using maximum temperatures, we avoid this bias and employ a measurement that is more biologically relevant to thermally sesnitive taxa such as brook trout. 

Nonetheless,  @mohseni1999a, @caissie2001, and @mohseni2003 have all found that the logistic model did not fit well to temperatures grouped at daily intervals. 




- Despite the fact that nonlinear models can sometimes better explain thermal sensitivity (as in our case), linear fits remain useful because they allow the comparison of slopes with those found by other researchers. Our estimates of slopes for weekly linear regressions are roughly in line with those reported in previous reports [see Table 3 in @beaufort2020]. Linear slopes were generally lower/higher than findings from other studies, indicating that water temperatures at trout habitat in the southeast US are more/less buffered than those in other regions.

## Prediction

By using widely available landscape characteristics, our methods allow us to predict thermal sensitivity at unsampled sites. We tested this method using data from the NHDplus and StreamCat at __ sites of known brook trout habitat in the southern Appalachian region.

Could we be missing influences of TS occurring outside of the watershed? @wang-erlandsson2018 found that local precipitation and flow were more influenced by land-use changes outside of the basin than those inside the basin.

A common drawback of studies of thermal sensitivity is that air temperatures are derived from model outputs or the most convenient meteorological station [@beaufort2020; @hare2021; @kelleher2012]. This means that trends in air temperatures used for analysis may not reflect the true trends influencing stream temperature at the local scale [@kanno2014]. Solar radiation and the influence of local topography have been shown to substantial influence variation in the microclimate across the landscape, particularly in mountainous areas [@aalto2017; @tscholl2022]. Furthermore, weather stations are commonly situated in open, flat areas where they miss the thermal effecs of topography and tree cover [@defrenne2016; @graae2012]. By pairing air and water temperature loggers, our study design allows the consideration of highly local atmospheric influence on stream temperature.
