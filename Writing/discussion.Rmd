Our work represents one of the most geographically extensive analyses of thermal habitat for an aquatic species of conservation concern. The paired stream-air temperature data showed much thermal variation among 203 stream segments distributed along approximately 1,000 km of habitat, including some segments where stream temperatures were stable over time (weekly average ~10 $^\circ$C; Fig. \@ref(fig:logistic-fits-plot)) and others where stream temperatures warmed readily with increasing air temperatures. Such spatial thermal variability has been observed in other brook trout studies conducted over more geographically confined areas [@kanno2014; @trumbo2014]. Given the thermal heterogeneity over space and upper thermal limits of brook trout [22-24 $^\circ$C: @eaton1995; @hartman2008; @wehrly2007], our study demonstrates that some current brook trout streams will likely maintain their thermal habitat suitability over a long period of time and may serve as climate refugia. Principal components derived from landscape variables in the NHD explained only a moderate amount of variation in thermal sensitivity among stream segments, showing that coarse scale landscape data have limited abilities in describing why thermal heterogeneity exists among stream segments.  Despite some limitations, our analysis revealed latitudinal patterns of thermal refugia locations and should serve as a basis in quantifying climate change impacts on aquatic species over a broad spatial extent. Overall, our study highlights the importance of embracing spatial thermal variability for identifying thermal refugia and using this knowledge in maximizing the chance of sustaining coldwater species in a large landscape.

We found a latitudinal pattern of thermal refugia locations, where thermally resistant stream segments were clustered in the southern area (i.e., North Carolina and Tennessee) of the study region. More thermally resistant stream segments were characterized with cooler maximum average weekly temperatures, and this correlation between different thermal metrics provided additional support for the robustness of our thermal refugia predictions. The latitudinal pattern of thermal sensitivity was likely due to spatial gradients of elevation in this study area, where elevation peaks in the southern area and decreases northward. Elevation has previously been linked to thermal regimes that differ over space [@isaak2017; @maheu2016; @trumbo2014]. Our finding contrasts with those of @flebbe2006, who did not account for spatially heterogeneous stream-air temperature relationships and projected a nearly complete eradication of southern Appalachian brook trout populations under future warming scenarios. The predominance of thermally resistant segments in the southern part of their range may also be explained by the legacy of anthropogenic impacts in which brook trout have declined most severely in that area [@larson1985; @hudy2008] and extant populations are confined to the most thermally resistant segments that represent a subset of their historical habitat range. In this sense, additional loss of brook trout habitat due to warming temperatures may occur more frequently at thermally sensitive stream segments located farther north in our study area. We also identified geographically confined clusters of thermal refugia in central Appalachian Mountains region areas such as eastern West Virginia and eastern Maryland. We located several segments with the least sensitive stream temperatures and logistic regression slopes < 0.5. Overall, stream thermal sensitivity in our study area (mean slope = `r round(mean(weekly_nonlinear_slopes.table$mean), 2)`) was within the range reported by other authors [@beaufort2020; @krider2013; @webb1992]. In general, thermal sensitivity of stream temperatures was spatially autocorrelated, although this was not always the case in our data set and previous studies [@kanno2014; @snyder2015]. Our work is useful for identifying general clusters where thermal refugia mostly likely occur, to guide where conservation and restoration might be prioritized.

In addition to the latitudinal pattern in thermal refugia, the principal components of landscape variables and correlation analysis revealed complexities of thermal controls over space. In general, water temperature was more buffered against changes in air temperature where streams had high early summer flows, low winter flows, and groundwater input. The degree of groundwater influence, represented by baseflow index, has consistently been identified as a determinant of thermal sensitivity [@beaufort2020; @briggs2018; @johnson2017; @kelleher2012; @tague2007]. The importance of groundwater input at these segments can be inferred qualitatively by inspecting the geographic situations of thermally stable stream segments. As with Ewin Run in West Virginia (Fig. \@ref(fig:logistic-fits-plot)), which is situated downstream of a noted spring, or Dumpling Spring Run in West Virginia, groundwater inflows appear to be responsible for their stability. In our study, metrics of water velocity (second and fourth axes of PCA) also explained spatial variation in thermal sensitivity. We surmise that water velocity may be a surrogate for latent determinants of thermal sensitivity such as channel slope and morphology, which regulate solar radiation and surface-groundwater exchange [@caissie2006; @hauer2016]. Urban landcover and soil permeability and wetness also explained thermal sensitivity, but to a more limited extent. Sediment, geology, and landcover may be linked to processes that affect stream temperature resilience such as the water table depth and water retention in soils [@monk2013; @ryan1991; @snyder2015]. As correlational evidence, the principal components of landscape variables cannot robustly identify ecological processes that generate spatial heterogeneity in stream temperature. Irrespective of the process uncertainties, these statistical relationships contribute to predicting thermal sensitivity for all stream segments potentially occupied by brook trout in the study area. Previous research has used a limited number of landscape covariates to characterize spatial thermal variability [@beaufort2020; @kelleher2012; @tague2007], and multivariate approaches should be considered more frequently, and especially for predictive purposes.

The spatial grain of our thermal sensitivity predictions was for NHD stream segments, given the landscape data availability for the large geographic extent of this study. However, landscape covariates at this scale were limited in their ability to explain spatial variation in thermal sensitivity ($\bm{C}$ = 0.16). This results was not surprising, and previous studies have similarly found that coarse-scale landscape data have limited abilities to explain spatial thermal heterogeneity [@chang2013; @kelleher2012].  Furthermore, thermal heterogeneity can occur within stream segments [@fullerton2017; @kalbus2006; @selker2006] and aquatic organisms may cue in highly localized areas of cold stream temperature to avoid unsuitably high temperatures in summer [@matthews1997; @sullivan2021]. Additional research is warranted to investigate availability of spatially confined thermal refugia in stream segments whose stream temperatures were predicted to respond sensitively to air temperatures, and this requires methods to characterize fine-scale thermal heterogeneity [e.g., fiber-optics cable, @selker2006] and habitat use by aquatic organisms [e.g., temperature tags, @hahlbeck2022]. In the meantime, stream segments identified as thermal refugia in our study should be validated and this could be accomplished by deploying additional temperature loggers.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that some brook trout habitat will likely serve as thermal refugia in a changing climate, but that existing landscape data do not precisely predict their locations. This knowledge is critical for managing coldwater species in a warming climate and prioritizing conservation actions based on locations of climate refugia [@jones2014]. Importantly, climate refugia should be defined and located based on stream thermal regimes in conjunction with other key factors. Resistance and resiliency of aquatic populations under climate change depend not only on stream thermal regimes but also vulnerability of habitat to extreme wet (i.e., floods) and dry events (i.e., droughts) and habitat patch size and connectivity which affects post-disturbance recolonization and recovery of the populations [@ebersole2020]. Such an integrative approach to identifying climate refugia is similarly important to strategizing landscape-level conservation of brook trout and other coldwater-dependent organisms in the southern and central Appalachian Mountains region.
