Our work represents one of the most geographically extensive analyses of thermal habitat for an aquatic species of conservation concern. The paired stream-air temperature data showed much thermal variation among 203 sites distributed along approximately 1,000 km of habitat, including some sites where stream temperatures were stable over time (weekly average < 15 $^\circ$C) and others where stream temperatures warmed readily with increasing air temperatures. Such spatial thermal variability has been observed in other brook trout studies conducted over more geographically confined areas [@kanno2014; @trumbo2014]. Given the thermal heterogeneity over space and upper thermal limits of brook trout [22-24 $^\circ$C: @eaton1995; @hartman2008; @wehrly2007], our study demonstrates that some current brook trout streams will likely maintain their thermal habitat suitability over a long period of time and may serve as climate refugia. Notably, principal components derived from landscape variables in the NHD explained a vast majority of variation in thermal sensitivity among sites, showing that readily available regional landscape data may be sufficient for describing why thermal heterogeneity exits in a region. Overall, our study highlights the importance of embracing spatial thermal variability for identifying thermal refugia and using this knowledge in maximizing the chance of sustaining coldwater species in a large landscape.

We found a latitudinal pattern of thermal refugia locations, where thermally resistant sites were clustered in the southern area (i.e., North Carolina and Tennessee) of the study region. More thermally resistant sites were characterized with cooler maximum average weekly temperatures, and this correlation between different thermal metrics provided further support for the robustness of our thermal refugia predictions. We reason that the latitudinal pattern of thermal sensitivity was due to spatial gradients of elevation in this study area, where elevation peaks in the southern area and decreases northward. Elevation has frequently been linked to thermal regimes that differ over space [@isaak2017; @maheu2016; @trumbo2014]. This latitudinal gradient was also due to a cluster of moderately insensitive sites located in the southern Great Smoky Mountains in North Carolina and Georgia. Our finding of more thermally resistant sites in the southern area corroborates these results, as southerly sites have higher elevations than those in the north. Our finding contrasts with those of @flebbe2006, who did not account for spatially heterogeneous stream-air temperature relationships and projected a nearly complete eradication of southern Appalachian brook trout populations under future warming scenarios. Thermal refugia were also identified in the northern area such as eastern West Virginia and eastern Maryland. Here, we found several of our sites with the least sensitive stream temperatures and logistic regression slopes < 0.5. Overall, stream thermal sensitivity in our study area was typical of that reported by other authors [see Table 3 in @beaufort2020 for a comprehensive list], and average slope (0.85) fell within the range of those calculated for similar studies [0.3, @krider2013; 1.0, @webb1992]. In general, thermal sensitivity of stream temperatures was spatially autocorrelated, although this is not always the case in our data set and previous studies [@kanno2014; @snyder2015]. Our work is useful for identifying general clusters where thermal refugia mostly likely occur, to guide where conservation and restoration might be prioritized.

In addition to the conspicuous latitudinal pattern in locations of thermal refugia, the principal components of landscape variables and correlation analysis revealed complexities of thermal controls over space. In general, water temperature was more buffered against changes in air temperature when streams had high early summer flows, low winter flows, and groundwater input. The degree of groundwater influence, represented by baseflow index, has consistently been identified as a determinant of thermal sensitivity [@beaufort2020; @briggs2018; @johnson2017; @kelleher2012; @tague2007]. The importance of groundwater input at our sites can be inferred qualitatively by inspecting the geographic situations of thermally stable sites. As with Ewin Run in West Virginia (Fig. \@ref(fig:logistic-fits-plot)), which is situated downstream of a noted spring, or Dumpling Spring Run in West Virginia, groundwater inflows appear to be responsible for these anomalies. In our study, metrics of water velocity (second and fourth axes of PCA) also explained spatial variation in thermal sensitivity. We surmise that water velocity may be a surrogate for latent determinants of thermal sensitivity such as channel slope and morphology, which regulate solar radiation and surface-groundwater exchange [@caissie2006; @hauer2016]. Future research should seek to elucidate how winter stream velocity may influence thermal sensitivity. Urban landcover and soil permeability and wetness also explained thermal sensitivity, but to a more limited extent. Sediment, geology, and landcover may be linked to processes that affect stream temperature resiliency such as the water table depth and water retention in soils [@monk2013; @ryan1991; @snyder2015]. As correlational evidence, the principal components of landscape variables cannot robustly identify ecological processes that generate spatial heterogeneity in stream temperature. Irrespective of the process uncertainties, these statistical relationships serve predicting thermal sensitivity for all stream segments potentially occupied by brook trout in the study area. Previous research often used a limited number of landscape covariates to characterize spatial thermal variability [@beaufort2020; @kelleher2012; @tague2007], and multivariate approaches should be considered more frequently, and especially for predictive purposes.

The spatial grain of our thermal sensitivity predictions was for NHD stream segments, given the landscape data availability for the large geographic extent of this study. However, thermal heterogeneity can occur within stream segments [@fullerton2017; @kalbus2006; @selker2006] and aquatic organisms may cue in highly localized areas of cold stream temperature to avoid unsuitably high temperatures in summer [@matthews1997; @sullivan2021]. Additional research is warranted to investigate availability of spatially confined thermal refugia in stream segments that were predicted to respond insensitively to air temperatures, and this requires methods to characterize fine-scale thermal heterogeneity [e.g., fiber-optics cable, @selker2006] and habitat use by aquatic organisms [e.g., temperature tags, @hahlbeck2022]. In the meantime, stream segments identified as thermal refugia in our study should be validated and this could be accomplished by deploying additional pairs of stream and air temperature loggers.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that spatial thermal variability can be characterized by readily available landscape variables for a large region. This knowledge is critical for managing coldwater species in a warming climate and identifying locations of climate refugia [@jones2014]. Importantly, climate refugia should be defined and located based on stream thermal regimes in conjunction with other key factors. Resistance and resiliency of aquatic populations under climate change depend not only on stream thermal regimes but also vulnerability of habitat to extreme wet (i.e., floods) and dry events (i.e., droughts) and habitat patch size and connectivity which affects post-disturbance recolonization and recovery of the populations [@ebersole2020]. Such an integrative approach to identifying climate refugia is similarly important to strategizing landscape-level conservation of brook trout and other coldwater-dependent organisms in the southern and central Appalachian Mountains region.
