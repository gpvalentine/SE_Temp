Our work represents one of the most thorough analyses to date of thermal habitat for an imperiled aquatic species. We used observed air and water temperatures at 168 sites throughout the south and central eastern USA to quantify stream thermal stability at multiple temporal scales using multiple models. We relate this thermal stablility to hydraulic and landscape characteristics, inferring local drivers that allow prediction at nearly 9,000 unsampled sites spanning 1,000 km of brook trout habitat. We found that a) nonlinear and linear models performed similarly in our study region; b) stream thermal stability was best explained by local hydrology such as stream velocity, baseflow, and soil moisture; and c) a slim majority of preferred thermal habitat in the southeast is currently conserved. Our results build on a solid base of investigation into stream thermal sensitivity, incorporating the influence of landscape variables and expanding analysis into new regions of interest and for species of conservation concern. We emphasize the importance of hydrological variables in determining thermal stability By using widely available data, we can make predictions of thermal habitat for a vulnerable species and work toward landscape-level conservation planning.

## Landscape Influence

Landscape and hydrologic factors explained the vast majority of variance in stream thermal stability. This thermal stability, as measured by the maximum slope of logistic regression, was most highly influenced by principal component #2, incorporating summer water velocities, followed by priincipal components __ and __, incorporating __ and __. Water velocity is related to slope, which is generally correlated with thermal stability because low slopes and velocities are more easily heated through radiation and advection. When considered in analyses of thermal sensitivity, stream velocity or slope often take a back seat to groundwater influence [@beaufort2020]. However our results suggest that stream velocity may be more important in explaining stream temperature than previously thought. 

<!-- Stream velocity or slope are seldom included as explanatory variables in studies of stream thermal stability, however, our results support those of @beaufort2020 and @garner2015, which suggest that it may be more important in explaining stream temperature than previously thought. -->

We predicted that groundwater influence, as represented by baseflow index, would be the most important predictor of thermal stability (see @mayer2012 sec. 4.2 for more details). This factor has been commonly identified elsewhere as an influence on thermal stability [@beaufort2020; @briggs2018a; @johnson2020; @kelleher2012; @tague2007]. In the end, the PC including baseflow index has the second strongest effect on thermal stability. This may be due to the fact that groundwater remains difficult to measure and predict over broad spatial scales such as that of our study (Kalbus et al., 2006). Also significantly influential was the principal component incorporating local sediment and landcover. Geology can be directly related to groundwater [@tague2007]. Sedimentation has long been known to influence stream temperatures [@ryan1991], but as a landscape characteristic, sediments have not been linked to stream thermal stability. Mixed forest within the stream catchment has been identified as an important factor in creating coldwater refugia [@monk2013].

While our results support the findings of other authors - namely that groundwater can have important influence on stream thermal stability - they also lend support to hydrologic influences such as streamflow and identify novel linkages such as soil moisture. Future research should seek to identify mechanisms behind these novel influences on stream temperature.

While base flow index was highly ranked in PC __, this PC was eclipsed by those including streamflow and landcover

## Model Comparison

We found that nonlinear and linear regression performed similarly. Research is divided in its assessment of the relative fits of these two models, and differences in fit are often related to the latitude and region of the study area. Researchers at higher latitudes and cooler climates in North America generally favor the fit of logistic regression [@kelleher2012; @mayer2012], while work in warmer climates such as southern Europe [@beaufort2020] generally favors linear regression. Nonlinear fits such as generalized additive models (GAMs) have occasionally been favored as well [@laanaya2017]. Relative fits likely vary by region because differences are mainly attributable to model behavior at high and low air temperatures where nonlinear behavior occurs. In locations where freezing air temperatures are rare (or removed for analysis), linear regressions often fit best. Where air temperatures below freezing are more common, nonlinear fits may be favored. Despite the fact that our study area was at relatively low latitudes, due to its elevation, it can experience freezing temperatures in winter. Future work should seek to establish how linear and nonlinear regressions of thermal stability compare in regions that lack freezing air temperatures.

Despite the fact that nonlinear models can sometimes better explain thermal stability, linear fits remain useful because they allow simple comparisons of slopes between studies. Our estimates of slopes for weekly linear regressions are roughly in line with those reported in previous reports [see Table 3 in @beaufort2020]. Linear slopes were generally lower/higher than findings from other studies, indicating that water temperatures at trout habitat in the southeast US are more/less buffered than those in other regions. 

<!-- Our results continue to establish consensus for improved model fit using temperature measurements aggregated at increasing temporal scales. We found that temperature values summarized at weekly intervals outperformed those summarized at daily intervals. This finding is in agreement with those of other researchers that have compared model fits at multiple temporal scales [@stefan1993; @kelleher2012; @morrill2005]. The supposed reason for this is that by aggregating across a broader temporal interval, the time lag between air and water temperatures can be negated [@stefan1993]. The temperature metrics employed vary by study. @beaufort2020, @kelleher2012, use average temperatures, while @chang2013 use maximum temperatures. We elected to model stream thermal sensitivity using maximum air and water temperatures at daily and weekly intervals. It should be noted that because variance is generally dampened as values are averaged at increasing intervals, modeling average temperature at increasing intervals would by necessity result in improved fit with each increase. By using maximum temperatures, we avoid this bias and employ a measurement that is more biologically relevant to thermally sensitive taxa such as brook trout.  -->
<!-- Nonetheless,  @mohseni1999a, @caissie2001, and @mohseni2003 have all found that the logistic model did not fit well to temperatures grouped at daily intervals.  -->

## Prediction
Effective management of aquatic resources depends heavily on predictive forecasting, and there is a need for informed predictions made at the broad scales at which ecological processes occur [@briggs2018a]. By using widely available landscape characteristics, our methods allow us to predict thermal stability at unsampled brook trout habitat throughout the southeastern USA. Given that our nonlinear model allows the inclusion of site-specific minimum and maximum water temperatures to more accurately fit the air-water temperature relationship, we chose to employ this model for predictions. Predicted stream thermal stability was highly influenced by these inputs of minimum and maximum stream temperatures, as illustrated by the similarity between predicted thermal stability (Fig. \@ref(fig:beta-predictions-plot)) and predicted minimum and maximum stream temperature (Appendix \@ref(fig:min-max-interpolated-map-plot)). Our predictions identified a moderate latitudinal gradient in thermal stability, with more consistently stable water temperatures occurring in the southern half of the study region. This finding is in contradiction to the prevailing thought that northerly brook trout habitat is generally preferable in this study region, and that poor southerly habitat may mark these populations for imminent extirpation [@flebbe2006].  Managers should consider that even if southerly habitat may have higher average water temperatures than northerly habitat, it may still hold value due to its thermal stability. In addition to this latitudinal gradient, we identified several areas marked by stable stream temperatures. These predicted thermal stabilities will be crucial for allocating funding and conservation resources throughout the study region. Predictions such as these can also be used to identify important thermal habitat for small-scale follow up research. Broad scale modeling of aquatic thermal habitat can be particularly useful when combined with microhabitat studies such as ___. Our work adds to a small but growing body of broad-scale thermal predictions in North America [e.g., @maheu2016a; @isaak2017a].

Our gap analysis revealed that a majority of thermally stable brook trout habitat in the study area already lies within protected areas. These protected areas are often highly conserved [@PADUS2022], and at the least are protected from the conversion of natural land cover to anthropogenic land cover. Conversely, this means that nearly half of this habitat remains vulnerable to human impacts and land use conversion. Brook trout are an aquatic indicator species, and they often cohabitate with other sensitive and threatened taxa [@vandusen2005; @vile2018]. Managers and conservationists seeking to conserve land in this region should incorporate stream thermal stability into their considerations.

A common drawback of studies of thermal stablity is that air temperatures are derived from model outputs or the most convenient meteorological station [@beaufort2020; @hare2021; @kelleher2012]. This means that trends in air temperatures used for analysis may not reflect the true trends influencing stream temperature at the local scale [@kanno2014]. Solar radiation and the influence of local topography have been shown to substantial influence variation in the microclimate across the landscape, particularly in mountainous areas [@aalto2017; @tscholl2022]. Furthermore, weather stations are commonly situated in open, flat areas where they miss the thermal effects of topography and tree cover [@defrenne2016; @graae2012]. We overcome this problem by using air temperatures measured in-situ at the same locations where water temperatures are measured. By using these paired air and water temperature loggers, our study design therefore allows the consideration of highly local atmospheric influence on stream temperature.

The use of PCA to reduce the number of landscape variables can limit our ability to assess the influence of any one variable on thermal stability. However, the PCA groups similar variables, meaning that distinguishing between variables contained in the same PC is not so necessary. Essentially, this is a trade-off between considering many variables to identify novel linkages and considering fewer variables to identify specific ecological relationships. 

## Final paragraph - reiterate most important finding
Thermal stability is a critical stream habitat characteristic that is influenced by local hydrologic and landscape factors. As climate change brings warmer and more variable air temperatures to temperate climates, stable and cool habitats will become important climate refugia [@jones2014]. Spatially explicit predictions such as ours offer important insight into regional patterns that may not be visible from localized studies, and these can help with important conservation and management decisions. Our results support and build on previous findings relating local landscape to stream temperatures.
