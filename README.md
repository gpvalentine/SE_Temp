# SE_Temp
Files for stream temperature modeling project. Kanno Lab, CSU. George Valentine george.valentine@colostate.edu

This R project/directory was initiated on Nov. 10, 2022 by George Valentine from existing project files (contact George for access)

* Analysis files in the initial commit are as they were in the former project on that date.
  + "Stream Temp PCA Analysis V4.R" was copied in as "SE_Temp_PCA.R"
  + "Gap analysis of sites with stable water temperatures.R" was copied in as "SE_Temp_gap_analysis.R"

* Writing files in the initial commit were brought in from v1, which was written in MS Word.
* Data files in the initial commit were copied in from the prior data organization, and are as they were on 11/10/22. In the future, data files can be brought/linked in from a data repository.
  + "SE_Temp_StreamCat_Covars_Combined.csv" was copied in from "/Users/georgepv/OneDrive - Colostate/SE Eco-Hydrology Project/Data/Temperature/StreamCat Data/""
  + "NS204_temps_daily.csv" and ""NS204_temps_weekly.csv" were copied in from "/Users/georgepv/OneDrive - Colostate/SE Eco-Hydrology Project/Data/Temperature/Temperature Data Working/Dolloff Temperature Data/Temperature Files/NorthSouth204/Processed Temp Data/"
  + "NS204_sites.csv" was copied in from "C:/Users/georgepv/OneDrive - Colostate/SE Eco-Hydrology Project/Data/Temperature/Temperature Data Working/Dolloff Temperature Data/Final Files/Final Temperature Data".
* Results files are created, version by version, by the analysis files, and saved in the "Results" folder. The writing files draw from those results.
